 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>5 feet apart</h3>
 <p>This is one of the bestest movie I have watched till now. Its really really really amazing.I just cant describe it in few words.You need to watch it by yourself and then you will come to know why was I saying this.In the whole movie the both,male and female protagonist maintain a distance of 5 feet and yet the chemistry and romance between them is out of the world.</p>
 <h3>October</h3>
 <p>This is a really slow bollywood movie which was a flop, still it is in the list of my top movies. It made me cry a lot .Due to this movie I have just started loving the flower Shiuly</p>
 <h3>Shiddat</h3>
 <p> This is also a very nice bollywood movie with a great twist in its end.</p>
